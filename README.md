# ETLproject

03/07/2020, Project Proposal:

"We selected two datasets recording the approval ratings of the current US president, one from Kaggle and one from FiveThirtyEight. Both datasets report the results of every public poll claiming to provide a representative sample of the population or electorate.
Our aim is to clean up the datasets and combine them using pandas. After that we will upload the resulting data into a non relational database in JSON format for easy querying."
